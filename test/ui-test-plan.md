# Nelson UI Test Plan

Run:

```powershell
python skills/test-ui/scripts/run_ui_tests.py
```

## Test case: Find matching tasks
**Aim:** Verify that `find` displays matching task descriptions in list order.
**Input:**
```text
todo read book
deadline return book /by 2026-06-06
todo attend class
find book
bye
```
**Expected output:**
```text
System booting...
       _   __     __
       / | / /___ / /________  ____
      /  |/ / __ \/ / ___/ __ \/ __ \
     / /|  /  __/ / (__  ) /_/ / / / /
    /_/ |_/\___/_/_/____/\____/_/ /_/

    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! I have a surprise for you. Your move!
    Type your move, or are you just going to let your time run out?
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Another thoughtless move? Fine. I have added this trivial task:
      [T][ ] read book
    Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Running out of time on your clock? Pathetic. I have added this task:
      [D][ ] return book (by: Jun 6 2026)
    Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Another thoughtless move? Fine. I have added this trivial task:
      [T][ ] attend class
    Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Here are the matching tasks in your list:
    1.[T][ ] read book
    2.[D][ ] return book (by: Jun 6 2026)
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Resigning already? Pathetic. I win.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## Manual persistence check: Load tasks at startup
**Aim:** Verify that Nelson restores saved tasks and completion status when it starts.

Before starting Nelson, create `data/nelson.txt` with:

```text
T | 1 | read book
D | 0 | return book | 2026-06-06
E | 0 | project meeting | 2026-08-06 | 2026-08-06
```

Then enter `list` followed by `bye`. The list should contain the three tasks, with `read book` marked as completed.

## Manual persistence checks: Missing and malformed storage
**Aim:** Verify that storage edge cases do not prevent Nelson from starting.

- Start Nelson with no `data` folder or `data/nelson.txt`; it should start with an empty task list.
- Add a task while the `data` folder is missing; Nelson should create the folder and file automatically.
- Add blank, incomplete, unknown-type, and invalid-status lines to `data/nelson.txt`; Nelson should ignore those lines and load valid records.
- Add a deadline or event with an old-style date such as `Sunday`; Nelson should skip that task and print a persona warning about the required `yyyy-MM-dd` format.

## Test case: Save tasks after mutations
**Aim:** Verify that adding, marking, unmarking, and deleting tasks preserve the existing console behavior while saving after each change.
**Input:**
```text
todo save this task
mark 1
unmark 1
delete 1
bye
```
**Expected output:**
```text
System booting...
       _   __     __
       / | / /___ / /________  ____
      /  |/ / __ \/ / ___/ __ \/ __ \
     / /|  /  __/ / (__  ) /_/ / / / /
    /_/ |_/\___/_/_/____/\____/_/ /_/

    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! I have a surprise for you. Your move!
    Type your move, or are you just going to let your time run out?
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Another thoughtless move? Fine. I have added this trivial task:
      [T][ ] save this task
    Now you have 1 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! You completed a task? Do not celebrate. I am already calculating 15 moves ahead.
    [X] save this task
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Taking back your move? Absolute blunder. Marked as not done yet:
    [ ] save this task
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Sweeping your mistakes under the rug already? Fine, I've banished this blunder:
      [T][ ] save this task
    Now you have 0 tasks in the list.
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Resigning already? Pathetic. I win.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## Test case: Welcome and resignation
**Aim:** Verify that Nelson greets the user and exits after bye.
**Input:**
```text
bye
```
**Expected output:**
```text
System booting...
       _   __     __
       / | / /___ / /________  ____
      /  |/ / __ \/ / ___/ __ \/ __ \
     / /|  /  __/ / (__  ) /_/ / / / /
    /_/ |_/\___/_/_/____/\____/_/ /_/

    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! I have a surprise for you. Your move!
    Type your move, or are you just going to let your time run out?
    ____________________________________________________________
    ____________________________________________________________
    Molo! Resigning already? Pathetic. I win.
    ____________________________________________________________
```

## Test case: Mark and unmark a task
**Aim:** Verify task status changes and numbered list formatting.
**Input:**
```text
todo read book
todo return book
mark 1
mark 2
unmark 2
list
bye
```
**Expected output:**
```text
System booting...
       _   __     __
       / | / /___ / /________  ____
      /  |/ / __ \/ / ___/ __ \/ __ \
     / /|  /  __/ / (__  ) /_/ / / / /
    /_/ |_/\___/_/_/____/\____/_/ /_/
